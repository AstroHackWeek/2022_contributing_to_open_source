Ok so I guess you are reading this because you want to use my code. There are some
functions that do stuff and they are:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and this other part does something.  I forgot why I did it:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, it's kind of your problem, not mine!
