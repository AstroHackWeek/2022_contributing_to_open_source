This is a library of commonly used functions in math. An example is as follows:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3628800

You can use these functions from the python interpreter, assuming you've installed this
library. Another example of a common function is as follows:

    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you find a problem with the code, documentation or implementation, please raise an
