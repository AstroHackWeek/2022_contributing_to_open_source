Hi! If you are here I guess that this code could be useful for you in some way (happy about that!). There are some
functions: the first one is a python function to compute the factorial.

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

This one is instead useful to compute the fibonacci sequence of a given number:
    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Hope that you understood how to use it, otherwise just ask me! :)
