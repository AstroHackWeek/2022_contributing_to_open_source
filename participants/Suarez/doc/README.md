##Hello, this is Crisel Suarez!
This is a README doc as part of the AstroHack Week lecture for contributing to open source projects.
In this directory we have several files to test and run code some functions including the fibonnacci and factorial functions.


    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9


    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
