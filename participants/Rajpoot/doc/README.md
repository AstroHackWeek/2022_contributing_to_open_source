The scripts in the repo have a few funtions. To use them you need to import them and below you can see how to use them.

This function calculates a factorial.

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

This function generates the fibonnaccci sequence.

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, then you can raise the issue and I'll look into it asap!
