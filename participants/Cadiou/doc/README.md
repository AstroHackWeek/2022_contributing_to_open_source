This package contains useful mathematical functions.

## factorial function

This computes the factorial of a number using a non-recursive approach.
The API is as follows:
 
    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

## Fibonacci function

This computes the Fibonacci sequence of a number using a recursive approach.
The API is as follows:

    >>> from simple_functions import fibonacci
    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
