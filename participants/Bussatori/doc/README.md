Hi to everyone! This is a small guide to use my python scripts for didactic in astronomy department. Here there are some useful functions for Mathematics classes. Here are some examples:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x=np.sqrt(64)
    >>> print(x)
    8

There is also the fibonacci function:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Please enjoy!
